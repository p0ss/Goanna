# A material format for Luanti

How LabPBR's channels line up with glTF 2.0's material model, what a file
naming convention cannot settle on its own, and a proposed shape for a
material description a game could ship. This is a proposal for discussion,
not something Goanna or Luanti implements today. What Goanna reads now is in
[materials](../systems/materials.md).

## How LabPBR maps onto glTF 2.0

Upstream discussion favours taking glTF 2.0 material semantics as the
starting point. The two standards overlap on the core of a PBR material and
diverge at the edges in both directions, so neither is a superset.

| LabPBR | glTF 2.0 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smoothness, `_s` R | `roughnessFactor` or roughness texture | The GGX roughness is `(1 - smoothness)` squared. glTF's `roughnessFactor` is perceptual, like Godot's `ROUGHNESS`, so it carries `1 - smoothness` |
| F0 and metal, `_s` G | `metallicFactor` or metallic texture | glTF has no metal table. Its model matches the LabPBR 255 case, albedo as F0 |
| Material AO, `_n` B | `occlusionTexture` | Direct equivalent |
| Normal, `_n` RG | `normalTexture` | **glTF specifies Y up, LabPBR stores Y down.** Whether a flip is needed depends on the mesh's V direction |
| Emission, `_s` A | `emissiveTexture` and `emissiveStrength` | LabPBR is a scalar mask read against albedo, glTF carries an emissive colour |
| Height, `_n` A | Nothing in core glTF | `KHR_materials_displacement` was never ratified |
| Porosity and SSS, `_s` B | Partly `KHR_materials_volume`, `KHR_materials_diffuse_transmission` | No single equivalent channel |
| Nothing | `transmission`, `ior` | LabPBR carries neither |
| Nothing | Anisotropy, clearcoat, sheen | glTF extensions with no LabPBR equivalent |

Read across, adopting LabPBR costs transmission and refraction and gains
height and scattering. The normal convention has to be reconciled either way.

## What a naming convention does not settle

A file name says which file. It says nothing about what the bytes mean, so
two clients can both support LabPBR and still disagree. These are the points
an agreement has to pin down, all of which we have hit in practice.

**Normal orientation.** As above, and note that the answer is not a property
of the texture alone. It cost us a day: first relief that did nothing we
could see, then, once we 'fixed' the orientation, black block sides.

**Colour space.** Which companions are sRGB and which are linear. Getting
this wrong is subtle, pervasive and hard to see in a screenshot.

**How texture modifiers propagate.** This is the Luanti specific question,
and the one no existing standard can answer, because Minecraft has no
equivalent. Luanti textures are expressions, not file names:
`default_stone.png^[colorize:#ff0000`, `^[crack:1:4:2`,
`[combine:16x16:0,0=a.png`, and the inventory cube form. An agreement has to
say what the companion of an
expression is. Reasonable answers exist: a colour only modifier leaves the
companions untouched, which is what makes one normal map serve every recolour
of a texture, and `[combine:` has to composite the companions in the same
layout as the diffuse. Until that is written down, every client will guess
differently.

That question also answers the standing objection to the naming convention
route, which is that it forces one normal map per texture and makes recoloured
variants duplicate their companions. Under Luanti's modifier syntax the base
image keeps its name, so the variants already share one companion for free.

**Palette interaction.** Luanti tints nodes per instance through `palette`
and `paramtype2 = color`. Whether that tint modulates only albedo, or also
F0 and emission, is undefined.

**Precedence.** What wins when the server serves `_n` for a texture and the
player's own client side texture pack also has one.

**Discovery.** Whether a client probes for companions, which is what Goanna
does and which needs nothing from the engine, or whether something declares
them up front. Probing works against every server that exists today.
Declaring is friendlier to a client that wants to plan its uploads or fall
back cleanly.

## A proposed shape

If the naming convention were formalised as the material agreement, the
smallest useful version is:

1. Companions are `<base>_n.png` and `<base>_s.png` beside `<base>.png`,
   with LabPBR channel assignments.
2. Normals are stored Y down as LabPBR has them, which matches the V
   direction of Luanti's tile UVs, so no client has to flip anything. State
   it explicitly rather than leaving it to be inferred from glTF.
3. All companions are linear. Only the diffuse is sRGB.
4. Companions attach to the base image of a texture expression. Modifiers
   that only change colour leave them alone. Modifiers that change layout
   apply the same layout to the companions.
5. Server media takes precedence over a client side pack, and a client may
   offer the player an override.

   Worth flagging before this is proposed anywhere: Luanti already does the
   opposite. `Client::loadMedia` inserts every media file with
   `prefer_local = true` (`client/texturesource.cpp:534`), so a player's
   `texture_path` overrides the server's art. That is what makes a texture
   pack a texture pack. Goanna matches upstream rather than this point, and
   the point should probably be rewritten to match reality: the local pack
   wins, and the interesting question is only whether a companion may be
   taken from a different source to the diffuse it dresses.
6. A client discovers companions by probing. No declaration is required.

Point 3 is the only place this departs from LabPBR, and it is one line in a
converter.

What this does not cover, and what a Lua side API would still be needed for,
is anything keyed to a node rather than to a texture: chamfer profiles, mote
emission, waving amplitude, whether a surface should be displaced at all.
Those are node properties, not surface properties, and no texture naming
scheme reaches them.
